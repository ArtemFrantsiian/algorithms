Find Two Elements
=================

Write the function solution(s, x) that takes a set *S* of *n* integers and another
integer *x*, determines whether or not there exist two elements in *S* whose sum is
exactly *x*. 

Performance of an algorithm must be O(n lg n)

Test cases
==========
Your code should pass the following test case(-s).

Input: solution({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, 3)
Output: True

Input: solution({26, 31, 41, 58, 59}, 82)
Output: False
