# Description

Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm


| Performance | Big O notation |
| --- | --- |
| Worst-case | О(n log n) |
| Best-case | O(n log n) |
| Average | О(n log n) |

## Explanation of work
The merge sort algorithm closely follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. Intuitively, it operates as follows.

**Divide**: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into two subsequences of n = 2
elements each.

**Conquer**: Sort the two subsequences recursively using merge sort.

**Combine**: Merge the two sorted subsequences to produce the sorted answer.
